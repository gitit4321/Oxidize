## Play the game!

## Installation
Make sure you have Node installed. Copy the repo into a directory on your machine and run npm install. Then run npm start and it will open up localhost:3000 with the react app in chrome. 

## Inspiration
We wanted to create a choose your own adventure style web app with mini games along the way. We didn't want to get bogged down in creative so we decided to adapt LOTR. 

## What it does
This is a web app built on React.js that allows the player to make choices, solve puzzles, and play mini games. 

## How we built it
We used npm create-react-app to set up our runtime environment then began layering React components to make our game! None of us had used React before this hackathon. 

## Challenges we ran into
This was an entirely new framework to all three of us so there were definitely a lot of challenges. We all had some JavaScript experience though so nothing was impossible to overcome. Some of the issues we faced include: percolating state from child to parent, passing functions from parent to child and vice versa, memory leaks from unmounted processes, different programming styles (functional components vs. class components) and many more!

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are super proud of developing a functional and clean game on a framework that we have never used. This was all of our first time even building a game or app outside of the structured setting of the OSU curriculum. We learned a lot and we worked very well together to overcome any challenges our teammates faced. 


## What we learned
An entire framework!! (kind of)

## What's next for Frodo's Nine Lives
We will likely try to polish a few things up then shamelessly spam it to potential employers in the hope of landing a dev job!
